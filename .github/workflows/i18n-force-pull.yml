# This is similar to the "Pull Translations" workflow, but without the conditional check to allow us to
# forcefully pull down translations from Crowdin and create a PR regardless if all the translations are fulfilled.
#
# Intended to be used when we manually update translations in Crowdin UI and want to pull those down when
# they already exist.
