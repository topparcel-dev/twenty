Things I learned:

* When creating Materialied Views think about populating it first using the files from the fixtures
* When pushing your pipes prefer to push one by one so you can have more coherent error messages
* The Include files will be nodes that will be added at the start of your node in Tinybird UI
* It's best to stick only with only the CLI or the UI when developping in Tinybird
* If you want to format the data us the tb fmt command, perhaps we can add it to the linter in a next pull request.
